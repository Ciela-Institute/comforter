# Welcome to `tarp`'s documentation!

`tarp` is a small python package for performing statistical coverage tests to assess
the quality of posterior estimators.
<!-- `tarp` is framework-agnostic: it works with posterior estimators and samplers written in numpy, pytorch, jax. -->

`tarp`'s small API is documented below.
